	abstract = {The stiffness, strength, and safety of a bicycle wheel depend critically on the stiffness of its rim. However, the complicated cross-sections of modern bicycle rimsmake estimation of the stiffness by geometric methods very difficult. We have measured the radial bending stiffness and lateral-torsional stiffness of bicycle rims by experimental modal analysis using a smart phone microphone. Our acoustic method is fast, cheap, and non-destructive, and estimates the radial bending stiffness, EI11, to within 8\% and the torsional stiffness, GJ, to within 11\% as compared with a direct mechanical test. The acoustic method also provides a direct measurement of the coupled lateral-torsional effective stiffness, which is necessary for calculating many useful properties of bicycle wheels such as stiffness, buckling tension, and the influence of spoke tensioning. For a complete bicycle wheel, the lateral stiffness can be determined by a superposition of equivalent springs for each mode in series, where each mode stiffness contains a rim stiffness and spoke stiffness combined in parallel. We give example calculations on two realistic bicycle wheels using our experimentally derived rim properties to show how stiff spokes can compensate for a flexible rim, while a very stiff rim doesn't necessarily result in a stiff wheel.},

	abstract = {The radial, lateral, and tangential stiffness of spoked bicycle wheels depends upon the rim’s bending inertia, torsional inertia, the spoke sizes, and the spoke geometry. The spokes of three rear bicycle wheels of different spoke patterns were instrumented with strain gauges in order to investigate the effect of the spoke pattern on the spoke strain and fatigue resistance properties of the wheels. Spoke strains due to radial loads were measured in the laboratory. Time-records of the strain of a right pulling spoke were collected from each of the wheels under actual riding conditions. Analytical, numerical, laboratory, and ﬁeld studies show that spoke strains due to radial loads and in service conditions are insensitive to the spoke pattern. Small variations in the spoke strains between the wheels in the road tests can be attributed to variations in the loads, but do not signiﬁcantly affect the fatigue life of the wheels.},

This issue is addressed using exact structural elements within the finite element method. Results important to design are presented for a 32-spoke tension wheel of radial and tangenital spoke configurations and for a series of compression spoke wheels. Deflections and internal load distributions for fundamental rolling load inputs are given and compared. It is found that either wheel offers practicable structural performance, but each is unique and it serves little purpose to design one to meet characteristics of the other.},
